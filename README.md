# 2D Retro Shooter Game Made With JavaScript

This is a simple two-dimensional survival shooter game where the player faces endles waves of alien attacks. The game is inspired and has elements of older arcade games. The action takes place on a flat static 2D surface that is viewed from above. The goal of the game is to survive the endless waves of alien attacks as long as possible. Aliens are summoning from all sides and attacking in ever larger, stronger, faster and generally harder waves. There are various types of aliens where each of them has its own characteristics, and some even have superpowers. They differ in appearance, size, movement speed and strength. Stronger ones have super powers like teleporting, exploding on death, summoning other enemies, or shooting back at the player. In order to protect yourself, the player needs to use his laser weapon and strategically move around the surface to avoid the enemies.
